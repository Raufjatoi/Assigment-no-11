6. How does Python handle multiple conditions in an if-elif-else ladder ?

Ans:In an if-elif-else ladder, Python evaluates conditions sequentially.
Once it encounters a true condition, it executes the corresponding block and skips the remaining conditions.
If none are true, the else block is executed.
